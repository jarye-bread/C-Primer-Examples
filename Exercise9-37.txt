Exercise 9.37: Why don’t list or array have a capacity member?

array is fixed size and its size determined when you define a array 
same with list

vector and string only have the capacity because the containers
they have allocated memory and are better suited to adding elements
moving and copying around and allow them to shrink the space as well
if allocated as well.
